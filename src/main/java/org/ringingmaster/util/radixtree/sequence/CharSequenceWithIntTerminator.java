 * Generalized Suffix Tree require a different terminator per sequence, and if limited to the char range
 * this would impose an arbitrary limit on the range of of non-terminal characters supported and the number
 * of values which could be added.
 * 
 * The expectation is that all terminal values will be an integer > Character.MAX_VALUE
